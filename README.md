## liri-node-app
This is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface (LIRI) app similar to the Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface (SIRI) used in iPhones. While SIRI uses speech, LIRI utilizes command line node that takes in parameters and gives back data. This particular app searches Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.
